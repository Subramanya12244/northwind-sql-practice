# Q67 · Customers from the Same City

> **Revision Card**
> **Category:** Self Join | **Difficulty:** Easy
> **Concepts:** SELF JOIN · INNER JOIN · duplicate-pair elimination (`id < id`)
> **Outcome:** ⚠️ had mistakes (see §4)
> **Watch out for:** a correct join condition isn't enough — verify every SELECT column answers the question (select `c1.city`, not `c1.country`).

## 1. Problem

Retrieve pairs of customers from the same city.

**Objective:** Return every unique pair of customers who share the same city, along with that city. Exclude self-pairs and duplicate pairs.

**Tables:** `customers` (aliased twice: `c1`, `c2`)

**Expected output:**

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| customer_1_name | Contact name of the first customer |
| customer_2_name | Contact name of the second customer |
| city | The shared city |

| customer_1_name | customer_2_name | city |
|-----------------|-----------------|------|
| Maria Anders | Hanna Moos | Berlin |
| Ana Trujillo | Antonio Moreno | México D.F. |

## 2. My Approach

1. Reuse the Q66 template — "same city" is structurally identical to "same country".
2. Self-join `customers c1` to `customers c2` with `c1.customer_id < c2.customer_id` and `c1.city = c2.city`.
3. Select both contact names and the shared city.

## 3. My Solution (as submitted)

```sql
-- Join condition correct, but the SELECT showed the wrong dimension
SELECT c1.contact_name AS customer_1_name,
       c2.contact_name AS customer_2_name,
       c1.country              -- should be c1.city
FROM customers c1
JOIN customers c2
    ON c1.customer_id < c2.customer_id
    AND c1.city = c2.city;
```

## 4. Mistakes I Made

- ⚠️ **Wrong SELECT column:** the join condition correctly compared `c1.city = c2.city`, but the SELECT list showed `c1.country` instead of `c1.city` — a copy-paste error carried over from Q66. The rows were right; the displayed attribute was wrong. → Fix: select `c1.city`. Always verify the SELECT list matches the question's dimension, not just the join condition.

## 5. Correct / Optimal Solution

```sql
SELECT c1.contact_name AS customer_1_name,
       c2.contact_name AS customer_2_name,
       c1.city
FROM customers c1
JOIN customers c2
    ON c1.customer_id < c2.customer_id
    AND c1.city = c2.city;
```

## 6. Why This Works

**Why structurally identical to Q66:** "same city" is the same pattern as "same country" — only the matching column changes from `country` to `city`. The join structure, alias pattern, and deduplication condition are unchanged.

**The mistake to avoid:** the join condition `c1.city = c2.city` is the correct "same" condition — but the SELECT list must also show `c1.city`, not `c1.country`. These are easy to conflate when rapidly adapting one query to another, as this question's mistake demonstrates. The join condition determines which rows are returned; the SELECT list determines what is shown for those rows — both must independently match the requirement.

## 7. Common Pitfalls (generic)

- Getting the join condition right but selecting the wrong attribute — the query finds correct rows but displays the wrong column.
- Copy-pasting a near-identical query (e.g. from a "same country" question) and forgetting to update every reference to the changed dimension.
- Using `<>` instead of `<`, or omitting the `c1.city = c2.city` condition entirely.

## 8. Interview Follow-ups

**1. Q67 had the correct join condition but wrong SELECT column. What does this suggest about a common mistake type in SQL?**

It demonstrates that SQL errors are not always in the logic of the query — sometimes the query finds the right rows (correct join, correct filtering) but displays the wrong attribute. The join condition determines which rows are returned; the SELECT list determines what is shown for those rows. Both must independently match the requirement. A quick sanity check: 'does every column in my SELECT list answer the question being asked?' would catch this.

**2. How does this differ from Q66 structurally?**

Q66 and Q67 are structurally identical — same table, same alias pattern, same `<` deduplication. The only differences are: (1) the join condition uses `city` instead of `country`, and (2) the SELECT list shows `city` instead of `country`. This demonstrates that the SELF JOIN pair pattern is truly a template where only the matching dimension changes.

**3. How would you find customers from the same city AND the same country in one query?**

Add both conditions to the join: `ON c1.customer_id < c2.customer_id AND c1.city = c2.city AND c1.country = c2.country`. Since city is inherently within a country, this is equivalent to just matching on city — but explicitly including country makes the intent clearer and is more defensive against cities with the same name in different countries.

**4. How would you find cities with more than 2 customers without using a SELF JOIN?**

`SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS customer_count FROM customers GROUP BY city HAVING COUNT(*) > 2 ORDER BY customer_count DESC`. For just counting and filtering, GROUP BY HAVING is simpler. SELF JOIN is only needed when the output must show the actual pairs.

## 9. Key Takeaway

Always verify both the join condition AND the SELECT list against the question — a correct join with the wrong selected column still produces wrong output.
